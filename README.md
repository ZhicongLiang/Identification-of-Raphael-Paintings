# Identification-of-Raphael-Paintings
In this project, I applied the mehtod proposed in http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acha.2015.11.005 to predict the identity of 6 disputed paintings (maybe Raphael's) and reach a accuary of about 92.5 on leave-one-out cross validation, using tight frame feature extraction and neural network.
Another part I did is to explore some properties of Logistic Regerssion.

The functions or usage of the py files can be found in 'usage.txt'
